            <p>During summer of 2020, I got the opportunity to participate in the Delta Faucet Company factory in Greensburg, Indiana. Several of my tasks included
              Loading and unloading cleaning racks, PVD department, quality assurance, and transportation of completed parts. I am also trained to man tugger units.

            <p>During high school, I was extended a paying position in St. Paul's Cathedral Choir. St. Paul's Cathedral Choir was the only Cathedral Choir in 
              Ontario, so I quickly accepted. This job allowed me to tour to different parts of Ontario every month, as we were invited by other chuches in the Dioces
              of Huron to sing at their church.
