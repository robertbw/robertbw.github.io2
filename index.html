            <li><p>My name is Benjamin William Roberts and my origin is kind of complicated. I was born in middle Indiana,
              but moved to China for three years. After that, we moved back to America. I then went to high-school 
              in Canada, which was pretty cool. I wasn't initially sure that Computer Science was for me, but I found it
              interesting enough to pursue. I don't have much experience in the field, but it looks like this college aims
              to change that!
            </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    I have done quite a bit since I came here. I learned python, and took other classes like trees, theory of computation,
                    and am currently taking web development. I haven't gotten an internship yet, but I hope to change that this year!
                </p></li>
